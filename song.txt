I need a dollar, dollar
Dollar, that's what I need (Hey, hey)
Well, I need a dollar, dollar
Dollar, that's what I need (Hey, hey)
Said I need a dollar, dollar
Dollar, that's what I need
And if I share with you my story would you share your dollar with me?

Bad times are coming and I reap what I done sowed (Hey, hey)
Well, let me tell you something, all that glitters ain't gold (Hey, hey)
It's been a long old trouble, long old troublesome road
And I'm looking for somebody come and help me carry this load
[Chorus]
I need a dollar, dollar
Dollar, that's what I need (Hey, hey)
Well, I need a dollar, dollar
Dollar, that's what I need
